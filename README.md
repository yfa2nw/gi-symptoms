# GI Conditions Reference

An interactive study reference for common gastrointestinal conditions. Each condition covers its pathophysiology, etiology, symptoms and complications, diagnosis, and treatment. A built-in practice quiz has USMLE-style multiple-choice questions.

> **For educational use only.** This is a study aid, not a clinical reference. Do not use it for patient care.

## Getting started

There is nothing to install or build. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## Conditions covered

| Esophagus | Stomach | Intestines |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Features

### Reference pages

- **Search** matches condition names and the text inside each page, and highlights matches on the open page.
- **Section jump bar**: the title and section links stay at the top of the page while you scroll, and highlight the section you're reading.
- **Abbreviation tooltips**: hover over or focus any dotted-underlined term to see its definition.
- **Increased/Decreased labels** use both colour and an arrow shape.
- **Cross-links, plus Previous and Next buttons**, connect related conditions.
- **Shareable links**: each condition has its own address, e.g. `index.html#gerd`.
- **Light and dark themes**: the page follows your system setting, or you can switch with the toggle in the sidebar.
- **Phone layout**: the sidebar becomes a compact top bar.

### Practice quiz

Open it from the **Practice quiz** button in the sidebar, the **Quiz me** button on any condition page, or `index.html#quiz`.

- 61 clinical-vignette questions:
  - **Step 1** questions test mechanisms, microbiology and pathology.
  - **Step 2 CK** questions test diagnosis and the next step in management.
- Filter by topic, exam, and whether you've answered or missed a question before. Choose 5, 10, 20 or all questions.
- After each answer you get an explanation, notes on why some of the wrong options are wrong, and a link to review the topic.
- The results screen shows your score by topic and by exam, a full answer review, and a **Retry missed** option.
- Progress is saved in your browser between visits.

## Editing content

### Adding or editing a condition

All condition content lives in `index.html`.

1. Add a button to the right group in the sidebar (`.condition-group`):

   ```html
   <button type="button" class="condition-item" data-condition="my-condition">My condition</button>
   ```

2. Add an article inside `#content-panel` with a matching `id`:

   ```html
   <article class="condition-content" id="my-condition">
       <h2>My Condition</h2>

       <section class="content-section">
           <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
           ...
       </section>
   </article>
   ```

   The section jump bar, the Previous and Next buttons, and the "Quiz me" button are generated automatically.

3. Useful building blocks:

   | Markup | Result |
   | --- | --- |
   | `<abbr class="term" tabindex="0" data-definition="...">ABC</abbr>` | Term with a definition tooltip |
   | `<span class="change up">Increased</span>` | ▲ Increased label (also `down` and `erratic`) |
   | `<button type="button" class="link-button" data-goto="gerd">GERD</button>` | Link to another condition |
   | `<p class="note">...</p>` | Highlighted callout |
   | `<span class="badge">Most common</span>` | Badge |

### Adding a quiz question

Add an entry to `QUIZ_QUESTIONS` in `questions.js`:

```js
{
    id: "gerd-example",            // unique and stable: saved progress uses it
    condition: "gerd",             // must match an article id
    step: 2,                       // 1 = Step 1, 2 = Step 2 CK
    stem: "A 45-year-old man ...", // clinical vignette
    leadIn: "Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    options: ["...", "...", "...", "...", "..."], // exactly five
    answer: 2,                     // index of the correct option
    explanation: "...",
    notes: { 0: "Why option 0 is wrong" },    // optional
    info: "Context beyond the course material", // optional, shown as "Additional information"
},
```

Options are shuffled when shown, so you can list them in any order.

## Browser support

The page works in current versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari. Highlighting search matches on a page needs the CSS Custom Highlight API. Browsers without it still filter the sidebar but don't highlight matches.

## Saved data

The theme choice (`gi-theme`) and quiz progress (`gi-quiz-history`) are saved in the browser's `localStorage` and never leave your device. To clear quiz progress, use **Reset progress** on the quiz setup screen.
